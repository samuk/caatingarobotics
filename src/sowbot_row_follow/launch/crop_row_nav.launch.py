# Adapted for caatinga_vision / Sowbot by Agroecology Lab CIC / Sowbot CIC.
#
# Launches crop_row_node with its own dedicated camera (standalone, no shared camera).
# The crop_row_node opens the camera directly via OpenCV VideoCapture.
# Run independently or alongside ia.launch.py using a different camera_index.
#
# Topics published:
#   /row_nav/image_raw                  Raw camera frames
#   /row_nav/debug_image                Annotated frames (view in Foxglove)
#   /aoc/conditions/row_offset          Normalised lateral offset [-1,1]
#   /aoc/conditions/row_heading_error   Heading error in radians
#   /aoc/heartbeat/neo_vision           Perception heartbeat for M10
#
# Optional (use_direct_cmd_vel:=true):
#   /cmd_vel                            Direct velocity output for field testing
#
# Usage:
#   ros2 launch caatinga_vision crop_row_nav.launch.py
#   ros2 launch caatinga_vision crop_row_nav.launch.py use_direct_cmd_vel:=true camera_index:=2
#   ros2 launch caatinga_vision crop_row_nav.launch.py camera_height_m:=0.8 linear_vel:=0.05
